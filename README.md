# PCSE_579
Work for Spring 2022 PCSE 579 at Christopher Newport University.

## Two wheel puzzle
The two wheel puzzle and the gui are contained in solution.py and gui.py.
"python gui.py" can be run from terminal, and the puzzle can then be played.
BFS, A*, and Bidirectional BFS have all been implemented as solvers for this puzzle.
To change between these solution methods, code must be altered in gui.py in the solve function.
